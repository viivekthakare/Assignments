What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","   \n"," - Python is a computer programming language that is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and easy to understand language which feels like reading simple English. This Pseudo code nature is easy to learn and understandable by beginners.\n"," - Python is popular because:\n","    - It is compatible with various programming paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented,\n","and functional programming.\n","    - Python has a large and active community of developers, an extensive standard library, and\n","third-party packages for various domains.\n","    - Free and open source\n","    - High level language\n","    - Wide Range of Applications Build websites and app, analyze and process data\n","    - Automate boring or repetitive tasks."],"metadata":{"id":"O5p-sAma3Efk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2.

What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n"," - Python Keywords are some predefined and reserved words in Python that have special meanings and functionality within the language.

Can keywords be used as variable names?\n"," - The keyword cannot be used as an identifier, function, or variable name because it’s already reserved by the programming language for a special purpose. This rule avoids confusion and helps the computer understand your code correctly."],"metadata":{"id":"lYPtBH1yo_JQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5. What is mutability in Python?\n"," - In Python, mutability is those whose content or internal state can be modified without creating a new object in memory.
