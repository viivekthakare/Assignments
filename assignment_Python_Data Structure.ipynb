They provide efficient ways to manage information based on its characteristics and intended use.\n","- Think of them as containers that hold your data and determine how you can interact with it. Different containers are better suited for different types of items.\n","- They important for following reason:\n","\n","  - Choosing the right data structure significantly impacts the efficiency and performance of your program.\n","  - Well-chosen data structures can:\n","  - Simplify data manipulation (adding, removing, modifying elements)\n","  - Optimize searching and sorting operations\n","  - Conserve memory usage\n"],"metadata":{"id":"G0DmCWQaAyjz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2.

(Syntax)\n","  - List: Written inside square brackets [ ]\n","  - Tuple: Written inside round brackets ( )\n","- Speed & Memory\n","  - Tuple Works faster and takes less memory (because it’s fixed).\n","  - List A bit slower and takes more memory (because it can grow or shrink).\n","- Use case\n","  - List: Use when you need data that may change later (like items in a shopping cart).\n","  - Tuple: Use when data should stay fixed (like coordinates (x, y) or days of the week).\n","- Functions You Can Use (Methods)\n","  - List: Has many functions like append() (add), remove(), sort(), etc.\n","  - Tuple: Only has two functions: count() and index()."],"metadata":{"id":"6SDHpFteGtpX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4.

Each key acts as a unique identifier for retrieving an associated value.\n","- Keys and values can be of various data types (strings, numbers, lists, and even other dictionaries).\n","- Operations:\n","  - Add: Use direct assignment (dictionary_name[key] = value) or .update() method.\n","  - Access: Retrieve values using their keys (value = dictionary_name[key]).\n","  - Remove: Use del dictionary_name[key], .pop(key), or .popitem().\n","  - Check membership: Use the in operator (key in dictionary_name)."],"metadata":{"id":"Gl38bb38IgHj"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","- A set automatically removes duplicates. If you don’t want repeated items, sets save you from writing extra code.\n","- With sets, you don’t need extra loops or conditionals to handle duplicates or comparisons.\n","- While checking in a set python uses hashing, so it jumps straight to the element (much faster).\n","- Sets are built for math-like operations (union, intersection, difference).\n"],"metadata":{"id":"JpjI8zN0JRID"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","- Characters arranged in an unchangeable order.

Substrings can be extracted using slicing.\n","- Strings can be joined together and altered using a variety of techniques (find, replace, etc.).\n","- The Set is different from list as:\n","    - String cannot modify in place its fixed sequence of characters (like a sentence).\n","    - List can modify in place its flexible container that can hold anything and can be changed.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"djrNJ1J7KEDT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7.

What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","- A hash table is a special kind of data structure that stores data in a way that makes searching, inserting, and deleting very fast.\n","- It works like a smart index system.\n","- Instead of searching through all items one by one, it uses a hash function to decide exactly where to store (or find) an item in memory.\n","- It relate to dictionaries in Python as:\n","    - A dictionary in Python is implemented using a hash table.\n","    - Keys in a dictionary must be hashable (immutable types like strings, numbers, tuples).\n","    - Values can be anything.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"gO7TaCFjLyTK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n","- In Python, a list can contain elements of different data types.\n","- That’s because Python lists are heterogeneous containers — they don’t require all elements to be of the same type.\n","- Lists can mix any objects: numbers, strings, functions, even customs data.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"pI_5_AivMqbK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["10.

Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","- Dictionaries in Python are called unordered because they use a hash table, where each key is turned into a hash value that decides its storage location in memory. This means the position of items depends on the hash, not the order of insertion, so in older Python versions the order of elements wasn’t guaranteed during iteration.\n","\n","- From Python 3.7 onward, dictionaries preserve insertion order, but their main purpose remains fast key lookups. When you access a value by key, Python ignores order and directly jumps to the memory slot using the hash function, giving O(1) retrieval time.

Behind the scenes, Python converts the key into a hash value, which points directly to where the data is stored in memory. This means finding a value is almost instant, no matter how big the dictionary gets.\n"," - In short, dictionary jumps directly to the value using the key."],"metadata":{"id":"-XiCsPWqdBJX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"vtHY3ZomeKm9"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1.
